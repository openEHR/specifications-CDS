= Preface

== Purpose

This document contains the design specifications of the Guideline Definition Language version 2 (GDL2). GDL2 is a formal language for expressing decision support logic. It is designed to be agnostic to languages, reference terminologies and standard EHR models. GDL2 is a major evolution from {openehr_cds_gdl}[GDL version 1^] ('GDL').

== A Note on Nomenclature

This specification uses the terms 'GDL2' and 'GDL' to refer to version 2 of GDL, i.e. the formalism described in this specification.

== Resources

The {gdl_lang_site}[GDL-lang site^] is a useful location for GDL-related research material. The {gdl_models_github}[GDL Github repository^] contains published GDLguidelines. The {gdl_wiki}[GDL wiki^] provides further material.

== Changes since GDL version 1 ('GDL')

GDL2 introduces the following changes with respect to the original release of GDL:

* Data binding agnostic to EHR data models (e.g. openEHR / {iso_13606}[ISO 13606^] / {hl7_fhir}[HL7 FHIR^]);
* Template definition for output objects with new `use_template` statement with template-level variables; this enables, for example CDS-Hooks Cards & Suggestions as result of rule executions;
* Individual references and ability to reference to specific items in the rules;
* More math functions support.

Migration of GDL1 to GDL2 guidelines is described on the {gdl2_migration_tutorial}[gdl-lang site^].
