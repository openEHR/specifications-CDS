# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in **specifications-CDS**.

## What this repo is

`specifications-CDS` is the **document source** for the openEHR **CDS** (Clinical Decision Support) component. It is a *specification* repo, not software: the deliverables are the HTML specs at https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/CDS/. Sources are **AsciiDoc** prose; the committed `docs/*.html` files are build artefacts.

`manifest.json` is the source of truth for which documents exist, their `spec_status`, releases, and the `SPECCDS` Jira roadmap. Published documents: `GDL`, `GDL2`.

CDS covers computable clinical guidelines: the Guideline Definition Language in its first version (GDL) and its successor GDL2, which expresses rules over archetype-bound variables. Guidelines reference archetypes and templates (AM) and operate on RM data, and the expression syntax relates to the expression languages in LANG. Executable guideline models and tooling are kept in `openEHR/gdl-guideline-models` and `openEHR/gdl-tools`, not here.

## Layout

- `docs/<document>/master.adoc` plus `masterNN-*.adoc` chapters (`master00` = amendment record); `manifest_vars.adoc` is generated from `manifest.json` on publish.
- `.asciidoctorconfig` — attributes for editor previews (`:component:`, `:imagesdir:`).

## Use the `openehr-specs@openehr` plugin

The plugin carries the spec-authoring know-how — **prefer its skills/agents over ad-hoc edits.** Don't re-derive their workflows here. `.claude/settings.json` registers the `openehr` marketplace and enables the plugin; Claude Code asks you to trust the folder first. To install it by hand: `/plugin marketplace add openEHR/ai-plugins`, then `/plugin install openehr-specs@openehr`.

| Task | Use |
|------|-----|
| Create/edit a spec, chapter, `master.adoc`, or `manifest.json` | skill `openehr-specs:authoring` |
| Spec prose style — overviews, semantics, design rationale | skill `openehr-specs:content-patterns` |
| Amendment record (`master00-amendment_record.adoc`) | skill `openehr-specs:amendment-record` |
| Releases, CR/PR, lifecycle status, Jira workflow | skill `openehr-specs:governance` |
| Quality / convention review of a document | skill `openehr-specs:review` |
| Whole-document convention review (all chapters) | agent `openehr-specs:spec-reviewer` |
| Fact-check class/attribute/function names in prose | agent `openehr-specs:identifier-grounding` |
| Audit `{openehr_*}` attributes + `<<anchor>>` cross-refs | agent `openehr-specs:xref-auditor` |
| Local HTML preview of this component (you run it) | `/openehr-specs:publish CDS` |
| Check this repo against the standard file set | `/openehr-specs:scaffold` |

## Build tool invocation

Docker is all you need to render the documents. All `specifications-XX` repos, including `specifications-AA_GLOBAL` (boilerplate, references), are cloned as siblings under one parent directory. Render from that parent directory:

```bash
# render HTML. The image is published from specifications-AA_GLOBAL; its entrypoint passes -q
# (package-qualified class files). Use `Release-X.Y.Z` instead of `development` for a release build.
docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$PWD:/documents/" ghcr.io/openehr/asciidoctor development CDS
```

The build prints `generated <file>` and exits 0 even when includes are missing, so read the log: any `ERROR` or `include file not found` line means incomplete output. It also rewrites the tracked `docs/*.html` artefacts.

## Conventions

### Commit messages

- **Format:** `Changes for <KEY> - <what changed>`, one line, for example `Changes for SPECCDS-42 - fix typos in the overview chapter`. Say what changed in the specification, not which file.
- **Several tickets:** join the numbers, `Changes for SPECCDS-49/50 - <what changed>`.
- **Every commit that has a Jira ticket carries its key.** Take it from, in order: the user, the branch name (`feat/SPECCDS-42-<slug>`), or the Jira issue the task links to (the `atlassian-openehr` MCP server can look an issue up). Never invent or guess a key.
- **Which key:** `SPECCDS` for this component (change requests), `SPECPR` for problem reports, `SPECPUB` for publishing and tooling issues, or the owning component's key (`SPECAM`, `SPECRM`, ...) when the change belongs there. See skill `openehr-specs:governance`.
- **No ticket:** write a plain summary without a key and say so in the pull request; do not use a placeholder key.
- Some history, mostly in other components, puts the key last, `<what changed> (SPECCDS-42)`. It is understood, but use the leading form here.
- A change to published specification text also needs an amendment-record entry with the same ticket (skill `openehr-specs:amendment-record`).
- Do not stage regenerated `docs/*.html` or generated class tables together with source changes unless the task is to refresh them.

### Branches

- Branch from `master` as `feat/<KEY>-<slug>` or `fix/<KEY>-<slug>`, for example `feat/SPECCDS-42-template-id`, and merge to `master` by pull request.
